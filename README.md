Forkify is a project from my Udemy Javascript course.
This application serves as a recipe finder and has the ability to transfer ingredients into a shopping cart, 
to change servings within the recipe and the shopping cart, and has a “like” list. 

Some additional functionality I’ve added includes: a message asking the user if they’d like to delete an item
from their shopping list when they indicate an amount below 0, 
and an algorithm for a more accurate estimate of the cooking time as servings change.
